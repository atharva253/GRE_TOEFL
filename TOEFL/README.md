# TOEFL
If you have prepared for GRE in the past, TOEFL would require maximum 10-14 days. The vocab prep you have done for GRE Verbal is more than sufficient for TOEFL. If not, you can complete the Basic and Common words from Magoosh Flashcards.

The most important aspect of preparation for TOEFL is to become comfortable with the pattern of questions in each section, which is pretty much fixed. For this, I would recommend taking a look at the [TOEFL Test Preparation: The Insider’s Guide](https://www.edx.org/course/toefl-test-preparation-the-insiders-guide) course on edX (Free). Though it is organized to be six-week course, you can complete watching all the videos in 2-3 days.  This course has been developed by the experts who create, administer and score the test. It also discusses some useful approaches to questions, information one must focus on and time management tips. 

Though I have uploaded the official guide to TOEFL IBT, I mostly relied on the four mock tests that came with it. The interface is similar to that of the actual exam. The only drawback is that it does not evaluate your responses for the Speaking and Writing Sections. You might need to get feedback from your seniors / friends. If you are short of time, read the model responses thoroughly.

Some general tips for the Speaking Section:
- Avoid “umm”, “a” or “uh” while speaking. You can instead pause for a second or two and recollect your thoughts.
- Pay attention to your intonation and pronunciation.
- Avoid speaking about things you do not remember clearly.
- It’s fine if you finish early or get cut off at the end as long as the crux of the conversation is present.

Some general tips for the Writing Section:
- Avoid unnecessary jargon in the essays.
- Pay attention to the punctuations and spellings. Learn to use the semicolon and the colon correctly in a sentence.
