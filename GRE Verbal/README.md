# GRE Verbal
As an Engineering / Science student, it is likely that you will spend most of your preparation time on the Verbal Section. It is indeed the toughest part of GRE and requires regular practice. The key to performing well in this section is having a strong command of the words which frequently appear in the GRE. It is important to not just remember the meaning of the word but also understand how the meaning changes in different contexts. This is something you can develop by practicing as many questions as possible.
Here are some word lists I followed during my preparation. In my opinion, these lists are exhaustive for GRE and you do not need to refer to any more such lists (unless you are aiming for a 165+).

## 1) Magoosh Flashcards:
- I would recommend going through all the decks, though Basic and Common words are at a higher priority. 
- You can complete one deck everyday for six days and use the seventh day to revise all the words you have learnt during the previous week. This will take you around three weeks to complete all the words.
- You might find some words that you tend to forget easily. I would advise making a note of these words and their meanings so that you could revise them when the exam is a few days away.
## 2) Barron 800:  
- If you are done with the Magoosh Flashcards and still have a week left, I would suggest going through this list too. 
- A lot of words overlap with the Magoosh Flashcards and so this list should not take you more than 3 days.   

Once you are done with the Basic decks from the Magoosh Flashcards, it's time to start solving questions. I relied completely on the Magoosh Verbal Exercise Questions and solved almost all of them. The questions seemed to be slightly tougher than the actual GRE Verbal exam, but I believe that would prepare you for the worst. 

Also, Magoosh Exercises have video solutions which teach you some guessing and option-elimination skills. I would recommend going through all these videos, even if you get the question right. 

You might learn new words from these questions too. Make a note of them in a separate document and revise them before your exam.
