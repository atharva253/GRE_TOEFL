# GRE_TOEFL
The objective of this repo is to steer your GRE and TOEFL preparation, such that you can make the most of your time and resources. Though it is possible to perform well in these exams with a monthâ€™s preparation, you can plan it out based on your other time commitments (coursework, internship, projects). 

In this guide, I aim to share some resources I found useful during my preparation and give some exam tips to help structure your preparation. For the most part, I have followed the exceedingly helpful GRE_PREP guide by Amogh Dabholkar and Dhruva Barfiwala. I hope to further streamline it based on what worked best for me. I have tried to minimize the material required to a good extent. If you need further material / guidance, I would recommend checking out their guide too. It is assumed that you have prepared for JEE in the past and have a decent background in high school mathematics.

*Credentials*:

GRE Score: 331/340 (Quant: 169/170, Verbal: 162/170, AWA: 4/6)

TOEFL Score: 109/120 (R: 30, L: 28, S: 26, W: 25) 

*General Tips*:
- Though I gave my exams in August and September, I would strongly advice giving them as early as possible. That would give you ample time to prepare and give them again, if required. An ideal time would be May/June. Some people even manage to complete them in their third year.
- Before you register for GRE and TOEFL, you need to have a valid passport. Also, make sure your name on the passport exactly matches with that on the application to avoid future hassle.
- Prepare a timeline, choose your resources and stick to them. Avoid changing the books / online resources you follow during your journey unless it is absolutely necessary.

I hope this guide helps you make the right choices.

All the best !!
