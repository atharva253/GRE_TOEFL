# GRE AWA
You can allot 3-4 days before the exam for AWA Prep. It is beneficial to have a score greater than or equal to 4, though you need not prepare extensively for it. One important thing to note is that the question asked in the GRE exam is chosen from a list of topics given by ETS. The following links contain the list of topics for the Issues and Arguments tasks.

1)	[Issues](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/analytical_writing/issue/pool)
2)	[Arguments](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/analytical_writing/argument/pool)

It is advisable to go through the Magoosh Lesson Videos for the AWA section. They give a clear and comprehensive introduction to the tasks, their scoring components and writing tips. You may also follow their suggested format, though that is not absolutely necessary. I particularly found their Brainstorming Technique for the Issues task and the examples of Logical Fallacies for the Arguments task useful. 

Once you complete the videos, you can take up one new prompt from the ETS website every day and write essays. Ideally, you should get them checked from your seniors or friends. In my case, I just had a couple of days to prepare for AWA. So, I instead spent the time reading model responses to prompts on Magoosh and the ETS PowerPrep Tests. You can find multiple responses awarded different scores for the same prompt. This is accompanied by comments with the reasons for awarding that score. That would give you a good idea about what they are looking for in the essays. You may also observe the length, flow and paragraph structure of the well-written essays.
