# GRE Quant
For someone who has prepared for JEE Mains and Advanced in the past, the quantitative section would be a lot easier. The syllabus is close to what you learn up to tenth grade. The major challenge here is to make minimum mistakes. You should aim for a near perfect (168-170) score in quant if you plan to apply to top Engineering / Computer Science schools.  

Your first step would be to attempt the diagnostic test from the Manhattan 5lb with a timer. If you get 18-20 questions right, you will most probably not require a dedicated revision plan. If not, identify specific topics you might need to brush up on. Spend a few days revising these topics either from your own notes or from Magoosh videos. 

For practice, I would strongly recommend solving the Manhattan 5lb book. The difficulty of questions matches that of GRE Quant paper. When you practice, make sure to time it such that you allot the same average time per question as you would in the actual test. For example, if a chapter has 40 questions, you should complete it in maximum 70 minutes. This would early on inculcate a habit of solving the questions quickly. Try your best to get all the questions right. Read the solutions to understand where you went wrong.

In my opinion, this book would be enough for quant. For further practice, you may solve GRE mock tests.
